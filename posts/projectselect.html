        The first day was creation of an air quality sensor using an Arduino. I
        disagree with the way it was made and the way the professor tought how
        to make it but I see why he tought it that way.

        As you can see this is using lego as the main structural component. This
        is not what I have a problem with. I have a proble with how this is
        supposed to "detect" air quality. It is just a LED and a photo resistor
        pointing at each other. The more resistance the photo resistor has, the
        less light it is reciving. The arduno was programed to make the LED
        strip change color when there was more resistance. The issue I have with
        this was that the photoresistor specifically and in general aren't that
        sensitive. My theory was proved correct, as when we tested it it did not
        change even when put to a cars exhaust. Also I was in a group of girls
        that day, who had no idea what they were doing (which is ok, we were
        there to learn) but they were not very open to my suggestions.

        The next day was making lotion. This one was fun, but nothing I would be
        interested in doing for a career. In the morning, me and my partner (it
        was a group of 2) tested different lotions. This was so we could
        determine what it was that we liked in them, and what we did not like.
        We eventually decided after testing 5 brands. I wont go into a lot of
        detail, but one thing we did like was its ability to rub in quickly.
        When it was time to make it, we were given a general recipie, but were
        encuraged to make changes to the ingredients, and we had options on some
        things. Our lotion did meet some of our needs but not all. Also we
        wanted there to be little to no after feel of sticky, as some lotions we
        had found did leave this. Our last criterion was that it had to not
        smell bad. This was easily handled by adding a few drops of essential
        oils (I think it was 2 drops of lemon and 2 drops of vanilla).
      </p>

      <p>
        If we had more time we would have made a new batch that would fit more
        of our needs, by changing the portions and ingredients. Also something
        that may have effected the final product we got was that we had made the
        oil stage and water stage seperately from each other (in terms of time).
        This may have somehow changed the final product we got in terms of
        consistency, and how well it rubs in. We also could have used something
        else other than grapeseed oil. Grapeseed oil was used, as it is the
        lightest we had found from our research. Lastly, we could have changed
        how fast we melted everything as this also changed something. Overall,
        this lab was helpful in teaching me a few things, but in addition I also
        determined that a career in that field is not what I want. It is too
        subjective.

        The next day was Microbiology! I throughly enjoyed this lab. We began
        the day by going out and collecting samples. Where we collected the
        samples from had a lot of biological gross-ness. We were able to look at
        it all under a microscope, and I saw a few motile microbes in my sample
        (not that it is anything special). Something I found interesting was
        theese things called petri-film. They are mini petri-dishes on paper,
        made by 3M. I had never seen them before, and they were really neat. I
        will be looking into them, as using a full petri dish is expensive,
        space inefficent, and a lot of work.
      </p>

      <p>
        After that we used actual petri-dishes to test the before and after of
        our water treatment device. We were given limited materials, but that
        was part of the challenge. The main thing that it was made of was a 2
        litre bottle with the top cut off and flipped upside down. Our water
        treatment device was one of the better ones, but we did not have the
        best. I did see a leak in the filtration part, but it was too late to do
        anything. This lab I learned a few things, but not as much as I did in
        other labs.

        The second to last lab was creating a photovoltaic cell (AKA solar
        pannel). We also made personal solar powered phone chargers. One
        interesting thing I noticed in the lab that we were in was that it had
        DI water on tap. I have not seen this before. I think it is from the
        Chem Eng distillery (not the alcohol kind of distillery). This is just
        something small I found about the lab that I have not seen before.
      </p>

      <p>
        This one has to my favorite of the 5. In the morning we made the cell,
        which was fun, but we had to let the dye set in, so we worked on the
        phone charger. The phone charger was fun, but also I didn't learn very
        much. I will add, it was something I would have never done on my own, as
        I am into other things in circutry.

        The last lab was creation of a plastic polymer. This also is not
        something that I am incredibly interested in. It all seems the same;
        mixing, pouring, heating, etc. I find it more interesting than the
        lotion lab, but not by much. I don't have any picture of the plastic I
        made, but it is nothing special. I would compare it to looking like
        fruit roll up. It has gotten harder after some time (1 week), but
        origninally it was similar. I did learn how materials are tested for
        strength however, and we watched some real "dog-bones" get ripped apart
        by a machine that mesaures how much force it takes to break something.
