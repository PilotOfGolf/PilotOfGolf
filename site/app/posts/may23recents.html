    <h2>What have I been up to?</h2>
    <p>
      Recently I have not been doing as much as I would like to be doing. I have
      been studying for my finals, and the wrapping up of chapters. I have still
      however been able to do some things.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        LED 2D Matrix. This would be simple if I were to just follow an online
        tutorial, however I am not, and doing it not as efficent. I am doing it
        where I have to multiplex an Arduino. It is sort of complicated, and
        currently I am working on finding a library, but I may just make my own.
      </li>
      <li>
        School VRC team. The new game, Over Under has been released, and I have
        also been working on some ideas for that. This year, I am going to take
        documentation seriously, as I did last year, but everone on the team
        discuraged it. Personally I think it is very important to do.
      </li>
      <li>
        Penny Sorter Automation. A simple device that is attached to a magnetic
        penny sorter, whose purpose is to sort copper pennies (older) from zinc
        (newer) pennies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ping pong ball robot. I am very excited to complete work on this one. It
        is a robot that seeks ping pong balls, goes to one, then collects it. I
        can't use an Arduino and will use a Raspberry Pi 4, as Arduino lack the
        ability to do a certian feature of it - use OpenCV and a camera.
        Certianly using an ultrasonic sensor would make this project quicker and
        easier, but I want to dabble with CV and AI.
      </li>
    </ul>

      Thats about all of the projects I am working on currently. On a personal
      note, I will soon be done with my freshman year of highschool. I know I
      certianly won't miss it. However, it was a learning experience. For
      example, I was completely new to the VEX V5 and Cortex stuff. Now, I feel
      very confident in it. I am not too dissapointed about not preforming well
      in our competetion, as I was learning. Also some of my teammates didn't
      really care about it. This coming year I want to do well, so as a result I
      am going to notebook everything, have a plan, and not just jump into it.
    </p>

      This summer I think is going to be very fun. I am in July going to
      Rose-Hulman for Project: Select. That is a week long program tought by
      professors about STEM. Also, I am taking actual colleges classes over the
      summer at Ivy Tech. I am taking Calculus and Psychology. I am nervous
      about it, sort of like imposter syndrome, this is because I had to test
      into them. Indeed I passed, but as with anything new, it is scary. I have
      been reviewing pre-calc like crazy recently, and am starting to feel
      confident. I know it isn't going to be the acedemics that I struggle with,
      but rather the whole idea of it being for college credit.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sort-of fear I wont have the time to work on some projects of mine
