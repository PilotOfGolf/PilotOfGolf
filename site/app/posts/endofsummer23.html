      <h2>End Of Summer Recap</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="content">
      <p>
        I feel weird about this summer. As summer is nearing it's end, I am
        looking back at what I have done. On one hand I feel like I did a lot of
        stuff, on the other I feel as if I did nothing. Something about myself;
        I don't like doing nothing, or feeling unproductive. I did A LOT of
        things, I know it. But I stil don't feel productive. This could be going
        back to a diagnosis of depression, but in an attempt to not feel
        depressed, I am going to highlight all that I have dont this summer.

        The summer began and I felt relived I was out of school. I though I
        would be able to golf a lot. I was not able to golf a lot, and have been
        more occupied with other things. One signifigant thing I did was fix my
        sprinkler system in my backyard. One of the head was broke when it was
        ran over by a lawn mower. It broke the head off the T fitting, so that
        had to be replaced too. This was a 2 day project, as I had the wrong
        fitting for the tube, and had to go back to the hardware store.
        Eventually it was fixed, but there is still an issue with the sprinkler
        system's plumbing. The water faucet is not connected to the wall very
        well, and may need replaced. This is something bigger and will need more
        time to do, as I will need to get some help doing this.

        Also this summer I took a college class. The class I took was PSYCH 101,
        Introduction to Psychology. I enjoyed my time taking it and learned a
        lot. Not only did I learn about psychology, but I also learned about the
        whole college academic enviorment (which I will later elaborate on).
        Personally, I did not find it much different than high school. However
        it was during a summer term and a hybrid learning class, so that means
        there was less people in the class. I think I did good for my first
        college class, as I finished with an A. I also learned about APA format,
        as one assignment doing a report in APA format. I prefer MLA still, as
        it is more paper efficent, thus ecologically friendly. The professor was
        really nice, and when I went to Rose Hulman, she was understanding of my
        situation and gave me an extention. Overall it was a pretty good class
        and experince.

        I have mentioned in a previous post how I am went to Rose Hulman Project
        Select. Firstly, I will say that my counselor Henry, was very nice, and
        seem to be the nicer of the 6. There were 5 academic days there and each
        day we did something different. On top of that there were fun activities
        that were hosted each day. If you want to find out more about my
        experince there, you can read my post
        <a href="projectselect.html">here</a>. One thing I will note however is
        that this also had an emphasis on social things, as there were mandatory
        social things. Some were fun (jack box games). Others were not (soccer
        on turf in 90 degree heat). But I was able to talk to other people
        interested in similar things, so that was nice.

        I also have been making some really good progress on my personal robot. I have most of the chasis built and all of the electronic circuts built. I need to work on the code some.
